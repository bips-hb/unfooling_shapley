# Shapley Addivitive Global ImportancE (SAGE)
This is an implementation to calculate SAGE values, as proposed by Covert et al (2020), https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00668

These SAGE values correspond to the Permutation estimator provided in the python version of SAGE values available at https://github.com/iancovert/sage . For the imputation of out-of-coalition features, the current implementation supports marginal imputation and knockoff imputation, which is an approach to impute out-of-coalition features conditional on the in-coalition features.
